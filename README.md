# Footwear Fusion

Footwear Fusion is a marketplace for shoe enthusiasts, operating as a simplified Kijiji clone where users can buy and sell various types of footwear. The full-stack app is built with server-side JavaScript (NodeJS, Express), utilizes PostgreSQL for database management, and employs jQuery and CSS preprocessors for a seamless UI/UX.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies using the npm install command.
2. Start the web server using the npm run local command. The app will be served at http://localhost:8080/.
3. Go to http://localhost:8080/ in your browser.

## Core Features

- Once you have registered and logged in, navigate to the list of all products to explore our selection of footwear. On the "All Products" page, you can browse through the various shoe options and use the filter to narrow down your choices based on your preferences.

- When you find a pair that catches your eye, click on the image to view more details. From here, you have the option to mark the item as a favorite and directly message the seller for any queries or to express interest in purchasing.

- For sellers, the "My Listings" page is your hub for managing your product listings. This page will display all the items you have put up for sale. You can mark an item as sold, edit the details of a listing, or delete a post entirely. The "Add New Product" option is also available here for when you have new footwear to offer to potential buyers.
